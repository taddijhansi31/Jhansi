What SDLC?
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) defines all the standard phases which are involved during the software development process. 
SDLC life cycle is a process of developing software through a phased manner in the following order

Requirements Gathering
Design the software
Build the Software
Test
Deployment
Maintenance.


Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is the testing process that is executed in a well-planned manner. In the STLC process, various activities are carried out to improve the quality of the product. However, STLC phases only deal with testing and detecting errors but not development itself.

Different companies define different phases in STLC. However, generic Software Test Life Cycle has the following stages.

Requirement Analysis
Test Planning
Test Development
Test Environment Setup
Test Execution & Closure

Objective	                    The main object of SDLC life cycle                                          The only objective of the STLC phase is testing.
                                        is to complete successful 
                                    development of the software including 
                                           testing and other phases.

Requirement Gathering	              In SDLC the business analyst                                               In STLC, the QA team analyze requirement 
                                      gathers the requirements and                                               documents like functional and non-functional
                                         create Development Plan                                                 documents and create System Test Plan

High & Low-Level Design	             In SDLC, the development team creates the high                              In STLC, the test analyst creates the 
                                                                                                                 Integration Test Plan

Coding	                             The real code is developed,                                                 The testing team prepares the test environment 
                                    and actual work takes place as per the                                               and executes them
                                            design documents.
                                    
                                        	
Maintenance                         SDLC phase also includes post-deployment                                     Testers, execute regression suits,
                                            supports and updates.                                                   usually automation scripts to check 
                                                                                                                           maintenance code deployed.
